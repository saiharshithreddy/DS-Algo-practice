    "Ans: In the previous semester, I worked on a project \"News classification and summarization\". This course was part of my Data mining course. I came up with the project idea and felt this project was a good to satisfy all the requirements given by the professor. One main reason I chose this project was that we can create our own dataset (which was one of the requirements given by the professor) It's easier to scrape news articles and create our own dataset. For data visualization, I chose Tablaeu, as the visualizations are dynamic and this would be something innovative in terms of visualization of data. The final outcome came out to be pretty good as we achieved 95+ accuracy in news prediction.     "
