Approach: DFS, Similar to Number of islands - instead of calling dfs on multiple 1s by looping through the matrix
DFS() is perfomed on one cell image[sr][sc] 
Time complexity : O(MN) where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns.
Space complexity : worst case O(M N) in case that the grid map is filled with lands where DFS goes by MÃ—N deep
