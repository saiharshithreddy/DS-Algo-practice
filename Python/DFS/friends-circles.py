APPROACH : DFS 
1. Each row is a person i.e 3x3 matrix has 3 persons friendâ€™s details.
2. Each column in a row represents its friendship with that person
3. say person0 => row_index = 0 => [1,1,0] => [friend with himself, friend with person1, not friend with person2]
4. go to each person and dfs all his friends but make sure to not re-visit.
