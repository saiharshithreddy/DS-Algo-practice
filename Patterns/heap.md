# Heap
A heap is a complete binary tree.

> The primary purpose of heaps is to return the smallest or largest element. This is because the time complexity of getting the minimum/maximum value from a min/max heap is O(1), i.e., constant time complexity. This way, algorithms that require retrieving the maximum/minimum value can be optimized. Heaps are also used to design Priority Queues. Some of the famous algorithms which are implemented using Heaps are Prim’s Algorithm, Dijkstra’s algorithm and the famous Heap Sort algorithm which is entirely based on the Heap data structure.
